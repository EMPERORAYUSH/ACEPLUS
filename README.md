## Usage

### Running the Application

1. **Start the backend server:**

    ```bash
    npm run start-backend
    ```

    This will start the Flask development server, typically on port 9027.

2. **Start the frontend development server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This will start the React development server, on port 3000.

3. **Access the application:**

    Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

### Environment Setup

AcePlus uses environment variables to manage configuration. Here's how to set them up:
1. **Backend Environment:**

    -   In the `backend` directory, locate the `.env.example` file
    -   Make a copy of `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    -   Open the `.env` file and configure the following sections:

        1. **MongoDB Configuration:**
        ```bash
        MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/?appName=<app>
        MONGODB_DB_CLASS9=student_database
        MONGODB_DB_CLASS10=student_database_class10
        ```

        2. **Flask Configuration:**
        ```bash
        FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key          # Required for security
        FLASK_PORT=9027                           # Default port
        FLASK_HOST=0.0.0.0                        # Default host
        FLASK_DEBUG=False                         # Set True for development
        ```

        3. **AI Provider Configuration:**
        ```bash
        # Example for Cerebras:
        CEREBRAS_API_KEY=your_cerebras_api_key
        CEREBRAS_BASE_URL=https://api.cerebras.ai/v1
        CEREBRAS_MODELS=["llama-3.1-70b", "llama-3.3-70b"]

        # Example for Gemini:
        GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
        GEMINI_BASE_URL=https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/
        ```

        4. **Model Selection:**
        ```bash
        IMAGE_MODEL_PROVIDER=GEMINI              # Provider for image processing
        IMAGE_MODEL=gemini-exp-1206              # Specific model to use
        
        PERFORMANCE_MODEL_PROVIDER=GEMINI        # Provider for performance tasks
        PERFORMANCE_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash-exp   # Specific model to use
        ```

    **Note:** Replace all placeholder values (like `your_secret_key`, `your_gemini_api_key`, etc.) with your actual configuration. You only need to configure the AI providers you plan to use.
### Adding Students and Teachers

#### **Student Data:**

Student data is stored in JSON files within the `backend/data` directory (visible after running [Backend Setup](#backend-setup)).

-   `students.json`: Contains data for Class 9 students.
-   `class10_students.json`: Contains data for Class 10 students.

Each file contains a JSON object where:

-   **Keys:** are the student's GR Number (e.g., "1234").
-   **Values:** are objects with the following structure:

```json
{
  "name": "Student Name",
  "roll": 25,
  "div": "A"
}
```

**To add a new student:**

1. Open the appropriate JSON file (`students.json` or `class10_students.json`).
2. Add a new key-value pair with the student's GR number as the key and their details as the value.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "1234": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "roll": 25,
    "div": "A"
  }
}
```

#### **Teacher Data:**

Teacher data is stored in the `teachers.json` file within the `backend/data` directory.

It's a JSON object where:

-   **Keys:** are the teacher's ID (e.g., "0001").
-   **Values:** are objects with the following structure:

```json
{
  "name": "Teacher Name",
  "subject": "Mathematics",
  "standard": [9, 10],
  "division": "A"
}
```

**To add a new teacher:**

1. Open `teachers.json`.
2. Add a new key-value pair with the teacher's ID as the key and their details as the value.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "0001": {
    "name": "Jane Smith",
    "subject": "Science",
    "standard": [9],
    "division": "B"
  }
}
```

**Important Notes:**

-   Ensure that the JSON format is strictly followed.
-   The application needs to be restarted for changes to these files to take effect.
-   Division should be one of: A, B, C, D, E.
-   Standard should be an array containing either 9, 10 or both.
-   Subject should be one of: Math, Science, English, SS.

### Adding Lessons using PDFs

AcePlus allows you to add lessons using PDF files. Here's how the process works:

1. **PDF Structure:**
    -   Place your PDF files in the `backend/pdfs` directory.
    -   Organize them into subfolders based on class and subject. The structure should follow this pattern:
    ```
    pdfs/
    ├── 9/
    │   ├── Math/
    │   ├── Science/
    │   └── SS/
    └── 10/
        ├── Math/
        ├── Science/
        └── SS/
    ```

2. **Naming Conventions:**
    -   **Science:** `lesson-{number}.pdf` (e.g., `lesson-1.pdf`, `lesson-2.pdf`)
    -   **Math:** `lesson{number}.pdf` (e.g., `lesson1.pdf`, `lesson2.pdf`)
    -   **Social Studies (SS):** `{prefix}.{number}.pdf` where the prefix is:
        -   `e` for Economics (e.g., `e.1.pdf`)
        -   `c` for Civics (e.g., `c.1.pdf`)
        -   `g` for Geography (e.g., `g.1.pdf`)
        -   `h` for History (e.g., `h.1.pdf`)

3. **Running the PDF Processing Script:**
    -   Navigate to the `backend/processing` directory: `cd backend/processing`
    -   Run the `pdf_to_questions.py` script: `python pdf_to_questions.py`
    -   This script will:
        1. Validate the PDF directory structure.
        2. Process each PDF using the configured AI model (Gemini).
        3. Extract questions, options, and answers from the PDFs.
        4. Format the extracted data into JSON.
        5. Save the generated questions in the `backend/data/lessons` (for Class 9) or `backend/data/lessons10` (for Class 10) directory, organized by subject.
        6. Create a `lessons.json` (or `lessons10.json`) file in `backend/data` that lists the available lessons for each subject.
        7. Store any incorrect questions (identified by the verification process) in the `backend/data/incorrect_questions` directory.
    
    **Important Notes:**
    -   Ensure that you have set up the environment variables correctly. Refer to the [Environment Setup](#environment-setup) section for configuration details.
    -   The processing script may take a significant amount of time depending on the number and size of the PDFs.
    -   The script will skip lessons that have already been processed (based on the existence of the corresponding JSON file).
    -   New lessons will be automatically visible in the frontend without requiring a restart.
