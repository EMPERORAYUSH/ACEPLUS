      "a": "An isosceles triangle has two equal sides, while an equilateral triangle has three equal sides.",
      "b": "An isosceles triangle has two equal angles, while an equilateral triangle has only one.",
      "c": "An isosceles triangle cannot be equilateral, but an equilateral triangle can be isosceles.",
      "d": "An isosceles triangle has no lines of symmetry, while an equilateral triangle has three."

    "question": "If \u2206 ABC and \u2206 PQR are congruent, and their areas are found to be equal, does this fact provide *additional* evidence for their congruence according to the chapter?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Yes, it is another criterion for congruence.",
      "b": "No, because congruence implies equal area; equal area does not imply congruence.",
      "c": "Yes, because it confirms similarity.",
      "d": "No, because area is a 2D property, not a 3D one."
    },
    "answer": "b"
