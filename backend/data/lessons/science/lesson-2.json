      "c": "Both methods are equally effective and can be used interchangeably.",
      "d": "Neither method is appropriate; centrifugation should be used instead."

    "question": "A student observes that when a beam of light is passed through a sample of milk, its path becomes visible, but this doesn't happen with a salt solution. Explain this phenomenon and discuss what it reveals about the nature of these substances.",
    "options": {
      "a": "Milk is a suspension while salt solution is a colloid; suspensions scatter light more.",
      "b": "Milk is a colloid while salt solution is a true solution; colloids exhibit the Tyndall effect.",
      "c": "Both are colloids, but milk has larger particles that scatter light more effectively.",
      "d": "The observation is incorrect; both should scatter light equally."

    "question": "In chromatography of black ink, different components travel different distances. Explain the principle behind this separation and discuss how factors like solvent polarity and stationary phase composition might affect the results.",
    "options": {
      "a": "Separation is based on particle size; solvent polarity and stationary phase have no effect.",
      "b": "Separation is based on color; changing solvent or stationary phase would not affect results.",
      "c": "Separation is based on different solubilities and attractions; changing solvent or stationary phase would alter separation.",
      "d": "Separation is random; results would be different each time regardless of conditions."

    "question": "A mixture contains a magnetic substance, a water-soluble substance, and a sublimable substance. Design a sequence of separation methods to isolate each component, explaining your rationale for each step.",
    "options": {
      "a": "Magnetic separation, then dissolution in water, then sublimation of the residue.",
      "b": "Sublimation first, then magnetic separation, then dissolution in water.",
      "c": "Dissolution in water first, then magnetic separation of the residue, then sublimation.",

    "question": "A student claims that all mixtures can be separated into pure substances by physical methods alone. Critically evaluate this statement, providing examples to support your argument.",
    "options": {
      "a": "The statement is correct; all mixtures can be separated physically given the right method.",
      "b": "The statement is incorrect; separation always involves both physical and chemical methods.",
      "c": "The statement is partially correct; it applies to heterogeneous mixtures but not homogeneous ones.",
      "d": "The statement is incorrect; some mixtures, like alloys, cannot be separated by physical methods alone."
